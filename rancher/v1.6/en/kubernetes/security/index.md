### Kubelet

The `kubelet` runs in host networking mode. This means that port **10250** is exposed on the host network. The port **10250** on the `kubelet` is used by the `kube-apiserver` (running on hosts labeled as **Orchestration Plane**) for exec and logs. It's very important to lock down access to this port, only the hosts labeled as **Orchestration Plane** should be able to access `kubelet` on port **10250**.

> **Note:** When using Rancher v1.6.15 and higher, the kubelet port is secured and can be only be accessed with a certificate internally generated by Rancher.

There is also a read-only port on the `kubelet`, port **10255**. This can be queried to gather container stats, and is used by `heapster`. As this can show possible sensitive data, only hosts labeled as **Compute Plane** should be able to access `kubelet` on port **10255**.

Finally `kubelet` exposes port **4194** for `cAdvisor`. While Kubernetes is in the process of [deprecating this functionality](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56523), it's important to lock down this port so no information is exposed from this interface.
